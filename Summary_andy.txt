N-cycle in beech and calcerous soils (Andy):

Overall functioning of N cycle:

#### Beech forests
	1/3 of EUropean BF is on calcareous soils that are highly susceptible to water deprivation
	Mechanisms of sensitivity of beech trees to climate change (less mm and higher T°)
		1)tree physiological limitation
		2)nutritional limitations due to lower N cycling turnover (specifically due to lowered bioavailable N)
			apply foremost on seedlings with restricted root systems and on calcareous soils, with low availability of N
	Trees compete with MO for organic and mineral N in a wide range of ecosystems with or without mycorrhizal help
		1) uptake of monomeric organic compounds (Amino Acids (AA))
			MO ammonification and MO uptake of dissolved organic N (DON) is reduced
		2) uptake of NH4+
			MO nitrification and MO immobilization is reduced
		3) uptake of NO3-
			MO utilization of NO3- is hindered
	Trees drive N cycling because/ with their organic matter decomposition and by root exsudates directly to the MO
	Adult beech growing on Rendzic Leptosol : decreased maximum NO3- uptake capacity and basal stem area with declining soil water availability 
		and has no opportunities to access deeper soil N pools in this shallow soil type.

#### Calcareous soils
	Rendzic Leptosols: Bioavailable N released by MO is often the limiting factor
		shallow profile
		high gravel content
		clayey texture
		low water and nutrient retention capacity
		Soil moisture is the major environmental driver of in situ nitrification in Rendzic Leptosols with maximum nitrification at 65% of maximal water holding capacity

#### Soil MO - Tree interaction
	many studies focused only on N cycle in soils without plants, with N cycle in Plants without MO
	Some studies focused on both, however, only researching the 15N recovery rates rather then the actual N turnover rates
		The N competition rather must be quantified in a process oriented way: determine the N turnover at the same time in plants and soils
		

#### N dynamics can adjust in an ecosystem to conserve the available N via low inorganic N production or a combination of high inorganic N production and consumption

#### NO3- consuming processes:
	Microbial immobilization
		NO3- uptake leads to reduced plant availability
		N is transformed into organic compounds and eventually mineralizes when the MO die
	dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ (NO3- --> NO2- --> NH4+ ; anaerobic)
	Denitrification (stops at N2 / N2O)


#### Denitrification
	NO3- or NO2- --> N2 or N2O
	N is used as electron acceptor [anaerobic]
	

#### Nitrification
	NH4+ --> NO2- --> NO3-
		 oxidizing bacteria convert NH4+ to Nitrite and then to Nitrate
	Controlled by
		balance of inorganic N assimilation
		gross nitrification

	## Net- VS Gross Nitrification:
		Net
			actual increase of Nitrate concentration in the soil
			Takes into account plant uptake, denitrification, MO immobilization/ assimilation
		Gross
			Total NO2- and NO3- production
			total acitivity of nitrifying bacteria

	Nitrification can promote soil acidification
	Higher nitrification != N- loss (NO3- leaching / N-gas production)
		plant uptake, MO / abiotic Immobilization can compensate therefore

#### N2O
	leaching during
		NO3- production (Gross nitrification)
		NO3- reduction (denitrification / red. to NH4+)
	Controlled by
		Forest floor water content
		Temperature

#### C:N ratio
	## Treshold of 25: below more nitrification takes place, the N storage capacity is reduced and NO3- leaching is higher
	Light fraction SOM has high C:N but can be lost after soil disturbances and vegetation changes
	favours NH4+ uptake, as heterotrophs are favoured, while autotrophic nitrifiers decrease
	favours NO3- assimilation, thus consuming if after it is produced by gross nitrification
	Atmospheric N- Deposition can cause an imbalance of C:N
	## Treshold Deposition rates
		< 10 kg / ha * y : no leaching
		10 -25 kg / ha * y : some leaching
		> 25 kg / ha * y : high leaching
	decomposition of C and N was 1:1 in different deuropean beech forests: first by leahcing of soluble compounds than by soil fauna fragmentation

#### Atospheric N Deposition
	can decrease C:N
	can alter even undisturbed Forest ecosystems
	can increase mineralization and Nitrification processes (in maple vs beech this was only the case in maple)
	
	The canopy is able to take up N and can also not take up N

#### Undisturbed Forest Ecosystems
	NH4+ and NO3- prodcution is counterbalanced by MO immobilization and plant uptake --> low losses
	Cycle can be altered by atmospheric deposition

#### Why care about N losses in forests?
	Nutrient stock is affected
	The GW and Streamwater quality suffers from it (NO3- leaching)
	Gasses react in the atosphere and get transported in ecosystems
	N2O is a radiatively active (absorbs and emits infrared radiation in the earths atmosphere)

#### N-Cycle in temperate forests
	is limited by N mineralization and Nitrification

#### fertilizer studies
	fert. can lead to artifacts: first the nitrification rates are increased, later they become less than in the control
		####   priming   #### of the soils: increased N induced increased mineralization rates (MO acitivity) and more C availability for MO
			MO can immobilize N
	
#### Tree adaptation to N
	to low N:
		N is translocated from old leaves to the trunk during senescence, stored over winter and translocated back into new leaves --> #### Nitrogen Use Efficiency ####
			altough bark yields little mass compared to the wood, the N concentration is higher in the bark and total amounts can be significant
		this is because for most decoduous trees the N requirements cannot be met solely by uptakes from soil
	some requirements can be met by NH4+ and NO3- wet depositions

#### Ratios in N Cycle:
	17 kg / ha * y --> 5 x higher nitrification than 10 kg / ha * y
	mean  deposition in EU beech forests is 4.1 kg/ ha * y

#### N Saturation:	__“nitrogen saturation” refers to the exceeded N assimilation capacity of forested ecosystems and enhanced nitrification is a symbol of saturation__
	can lead to P and K deficiencies
	Increase mineralization of SOM
		increased N uptake
		increased turnover rate of OM
	Reduce soil microbial acitivity, thus forest productivity
	High nitrate concentration result in cation leaching (primarily Ca and Al
	Mature forests are more prone to saturation than aggrading forests, as biomass accumulation is low
	Sat. is not reached, if there is a difference between requirement and uptake
		this shows deficiency
		there is retention and minimal leaching losses
	When N:P ratio in foliage does not change significantly trough the years, saturation might not be reached
		(Authors: sat. is controlled by plant uptake rather than  by soil microbial uptake so plant processes would be the first to change)
	
	
	
#### Precipitation / snow
	Litterfall production (Greek montainous beech forest study) increased in wetter years and so was N uptake
	High NO3- concentration during early snow melts, as mineralizes before leaf flush and uptake
	
	High rainfall can dilute N concentrations

#### Dissolved organic N
	Especially for stream water organic N can make up to 60% of total dissolved N
	Ammonium is retained more easily than nitrate trough abiotic fixation and assimilation by MO

#### Preferences of species
	European beech takes up more NH4+ than NO3-
	European beech takes up more NO3- than NH4+ (Dannemann 2016)

#### pH: see China study

#### Plant uptake
	Mineral VS Organic in trees
		trees can also take up organic N (This hypothesis is certainly favored by the growth of extramatrical ectomycorrhizal hyphae in the decaying leaves
	Is dirven by plant health (e.g., drought stress reduces N uptake)
	Is highest at the onset of the growin season

################################    Nitrogen turnover and N2O production in the forest floor of beech stands as influenced by forest management    ################################

Thinning was done at N and S exposure.

Effects of Thinning depend on:
	timespan of the thinning
	Microclimate
	Soil properties

#### Outcomes
	1) increased nitrification rate and NO3- concentration when thinning takes place
	2) Only on the North sites (-> Microsite dependency: N sites had lower C:N)
	3) Due to a lower C:N (thinning --> lower C:N)

################################    SOIL NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS IN BEECH AND MAPLE STANDS ALONG A NITROGEN DEPOSITION GRADIENT    ################################

N- deposition increased Mineralization and nitrification rates only in maple plots in organic horizons (for mineral soils the effect was weaker)
	-> the two species repond differently to N accumulation from atmospheric deposition
	-> forest species composition: species alter in decomposability of leaves because of different Lignin : N ratio in the leaves
		Species can respond differently in two ways:
			1) Soils accumulate N at different rates
			2) similar accumulation but different response (supported by results)
				for beech the Lignin : N ratio is high
					decomposability is low and N availability decreases for plants and MO
					reduced gross mineralzation rates
					higher C availability enhances immobilization of N (-> less leaching)
					(Allelochemical inhibition of N)
further hypothesis:
N deposition increases the patchiness of N Cycling
	higher deposition -> higher min. and nitr. only in maple
	ecosystem processes that repospond to slight shifts in N balance (seedling/ understory plant growth) may become more spatially heterogenous in mixed  species forests under high depositions

##############################    Low nitrate retention capacity in calcareous soil under woodland in the karst region of southwestern China   #####################################

#### Gross mineralization rate of organic N to NH4+ in carst soils was much lower than in red soils

####Total gross nitrification rate was higher in calcareous soil
	NO3- immobilization accounted for 2.9% in calcareous soils and 153% in red soils of the total nitrification
	Calcareous soils have low biological N retention and high losses

#### calcerous soils:
	as they have high share of Ca and Mg they have high pH
		oxidation rate of NH4+ to NO3- is boosted
		High pH can significantly stimulate the number of nitrifying bacteria (increase NH4+ -> NO3-)
		However high pH can degrade fungal growth
			(fungus can effectively degrade more immob. org. N and assimilate more NO3-


#### Hypothesis: (1) decreasing inorganic N supply capacity and (2) increasing NO3- consumption conserve N in this location
	2) tunred our wrong: few NO3- can be immobilized
		however the biological inorganic N supply capacity (including Mineralization of organic N and Oxidation of recalc. N to NO3-) was significantly decreased in calc. soils
			this can lower the total inorganic N inout and the available N losses. (Hyp. (1) confirmed)

#### red soils
	dominated by NH4+ (high mineralization of organic N to NH4+)
	low oxidation of NH4+ to NO3-
	high immobilization of NO3-

#### calcareous soils
	all the NH4+ was consumed
	only parts of NO3- were consumed (by plants or lost trough runoff)
		because more NH4+ was oxidized to NO3-
		because less immobilization
	

Morg = mineralization of organic N to NH4+
INO3 = immobilization of NO3- to recalcitrant organic N

############################################    Fate of nitrogen released from 15N-labeled litter in European beech forests    ###################################################

Introduction
	While litter N was released, exogenous N from the surrounding soil was incorporated into the decomposing litter
		by fungi
		and bacteria 
		and troughfall N
	after only 6 months the litter N was incorported into the tree and further partitioned
	after 3 years almost all litter N accumulated in the topsoil and only 2.5% was detected in the trees
	However, it is unknown how different soil types and growth conditions affect this process

#### outcomes:
	the input of exogenous N (30% of fungal provenience) exceeded the loss of litter N for 2 years, then a net loss of N in litter was observed
	also here it took 6 months for N uptake
	As there is no uptake peak, the different N fractions in the litter participated equally in tree uptake
	Trees are not a major sink of N
		--> decomposition of litter plays little role in forest N nutrition
			However this sink strenght is the same for deposited or fertilized N
				However, deposited N seems more available for trees
					Maybe, because of different fluxes and storage amount into the soil organic N pool of depositioned compared to litter N
	Litter released N --> organic N in topsoil --> diluted into the large organic N pool
	After 3 years almost all litter N was in the topsoil (0-2 cm) and a small proportion in the deep soil (2-30cm), hence became part of soil organic N pool
		high earthworm activity can explain increased N accumulation in deep soil layers
		an alternative, however less likely explanation is tranpsortation trough runoff
	litter layer can act as buffer at low deposition rates, whereas with increasing deposition, N was lost from N-saturated forests mainly by leaching
	N release is closely correlated with litter mass loss
	
#### unknown:
	the litter released N dynamics in the soil and the fluxes between the different soil compartments remain uncertain.
		(e.g. the size of MO-biomass varied trough sites and may affect the N fluxes)

############################################    Climate Change Impairs Nitrogen Cycling in European Beech Forests    #############################################################

####outcomes:

The statistical species range distribution modelling indicated a dramatic biome shift of European beech on calcareous soils, i.e., a reduction of almost 80% of the realized niche of beech in the year 2080
	however such predictions can neglect the adaptive capacities of tree species
The in situ CC revealed a lower growth on the SW exposure in the past 80 years of tree growth

#### N Cycle
	high rates of microbial mineralization-immobilisation turnover
	low soil inorganic N concentrations
	Microbial N turnover largely controlled soil inorganic N availability
	Glutamine uptake was either not significant or the C was metabolized already in the mycorrhizal mantle (as 15N but not 13C was present in trees)
	On SW the AOB community was reduced, so was the gross nitrification (5x), soil NO3- concentrations and tree NO3- uptake
		AOB community depend on ammonia oxidation without metabolic alternatives
	Other gen study: reduction of the transcripts of ammonia oxidizing archaea in the climate change treatment
	correlation between reduced gene copies of AOB and AOB abundance & nitrification suggests that CC triggers mechanisms of impaired nitrification activity
		NO3- availability declines
		seedling N uptake declines
	Ammonification and NH4+ levels were only marginally reduced in the CC treatment (unaltered mineralization rates)
	reduction of gross NO3- supply at SW in June equals to 2 kg N ha-1 day-1
		and thus has the potential to affect the N balance of the entire forest stand with its estimated N demand of roughly 100 kg N ha-1 growing season-1
	this statistical modelling approach is not based on physiology or biogeochemistry (on five bioclimatic variables entering the model including: yearly sum of degree days above 5°C, iso-thermality, a yearly drought index, sum of precipitation in the warmest quarter of the year and the precipitation of the most humid month)

#### limitation of the model
	regional differences of N availability and their impact on beech seedlings are not considered
		tackle this problem by using N limitation such as atmospheric N deposition, soil C:N ratio
			So that species distribution models should enhance their prediction skills
			so far the models focus on water and light as determinants of stand development and species competition: also N should be included
	such biogeochemical models can complement the dynamic species distribution models and better predict CC effects, taking into account N availability
		therefore such data is needed for all/ more forests
		










--------- QUESTIONs -----------
“(1) Trees may take up monomeric organic compounds such as amino acids thus limiting this substrate for microbial uptake of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and microbial ammonification. (2) Trees may take up ammonium (NH4+) thus reducing substrate availability for autotrophic nitrification and microbial immobilisation. (3) Trees may take up nitrate (NO3-) thus limiting microbial NO3- utilization [5,18,19–22].” ([Dannenmann et al., 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/52MCMPP5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AYVCZG7G?page=2&annotation=QYVH9AAI))

	is it only immobilization when speaking about NH4+ ??? why dont say
		Trees may take up nitrate (NO3-) thus limiting microbial NO3- IMMOBILIZATION [5,18,19–22]
		(1) Trees take up monomeric organic compounds thus limiting this substrate for microbial IMMOBILIZATION and microbial ammonification.

For the projection under future conditions, we used output from the global circulation model HADCM3 driven by the SRES scenario A2 [38] until the year 2080, which was calibrated and statistically downscaled to 30-arc-second tiles.

	what does it mean?
