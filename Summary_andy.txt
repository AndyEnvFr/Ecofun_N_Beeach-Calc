N-cycle in beech and calcerous soils (Andy):

Overall functioning of N cycle:

#### NO3- consuming processes:
	Microbial immobilization
		NO3- uptake leads to reduced plant availability
		N is transformed into organic compounds and eventually mineralizes when the MO die
	dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ (NO3- --> NO2- --> NH4+ ; anaerobic)
	Denitrification (stops at N2 / N2O)


#### Denitrification
	NO3- or NO2- --> N2 or N2O
	N is used as electron acceptor [anaerobic]
	

#### Nitrification
	NH4+ --> NO2- --> NO3-
		 oxidizing bacteria convert NH4+ to Nitrite and then to Nitrate
	Controlled by
		balance of inorganic N assimilation
		gross nitrification

	## Net- VS Gross Nitrification:
		Net
			actual increase of Nitrate concentration in the soil
			Takes into account plant uptake, denitrification, MO immobilization/ assimilation
		Gross
			Total NO2- and NO3- production
			total acitivity of nitrifying bacteria

	Nitrification can promote soil acidification
	Higher nitrification != N- loss (NO3- leaching / N-gas production)
		plant uptake, MO / abiotic Immobilization can compensate therefore

#### N2O
	leaching during
		NO3- production (Gross nitrification)
		NO3- reduction (denitrification / red. to NH4+)
	Controlled by
		Forest floor water content
		Temperature

#### C:N ratio
	## Treshold of 25: below more nitrification takes place, the N storage capacity is reduced and NO3- leaching is higher
	Light fraction SOM has high C:N but can be lost after soil disturbances and vegetation changes
	favours NH4+ uptake, as heterotrophs are favoured, while autotrophic nitrifiers decrease
	favours NO3- assimilation, thus consuming if after it is produced by gross nitrification
	Atmospheric N- Deposition can cause an imbalance of C:N

#### Atospheric N Deposition
	can decrease C:N
	can alter even undisturbed Forest ecosystems

#### Undisturbed Forest Ecosystems
	NH4+ and NO3- prodcution is counterbalanced by MO immobilization and plant uptake --> low losses
	Cycle can be altered by atmospheric deposition

#### Why care about N losses in forests?
	Nutrient stock is affected
	The GW and Streamwater quality suffers from it (NO3- leaching)
	Gasses react in the atosphere and get transported in ecosystems
	N2O is a radiatively active (absorbs and emits infrared radiation in the earths atmosphere)

Thinning was done at N and S exposure.

Effects of Thinning depend on:
	timespan of the thinning
	Microclimate
	Soil properties

#### Outcomes
	1) increased nitrification rate and NO3- concentration when thinning takes place
	2) Only on the North sites (-> Microsite dependency: N sites had lower C:N)
	3) Due to a lower C:N (thinning --> lower C:N)
