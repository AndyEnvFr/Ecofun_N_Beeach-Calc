Additions to the characterization of calcareous soils and the effects of extreme heat as well as drought (Mao)

Calcareous soils (compared to other soils) :
1. Literature: Acid and calcareous soils affect nitrogen nutrition and organic nitrogen uptake by beech seedlings (Fagus sylvatica L.) under drought, and their ectomycorrhizal community structure
    https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-2956-4
    Methods: Determine Tree biomass, root tip mycorrhizal colonization and community structure, root tip mortality, leaf area, photosynthesis, nitrogen concentrations, NUE and short-term 15N uptake from glutamine in five different soil types
    
    Related conclusion: Beech in calcareous has higher root mortality than in other soil types, and organic nitrogen uptake decreases more due to drought in calcareous soils than in acid soils
    (#My bad, didn't see that Tim read the same article as well :))

2. Literature: Microbial nitrogen turnover in soils under different types of natural forest
    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2003.07.014
    Related conclusion:  N cycling was tight in acid beech forests where microbial activity was limited by low soil pH. Indigenous pine forests on calcareous bedrock showed high microbial N storage（#not strict beech in calcareous soils bu may help）.
                                      Variability in N2O production was strongly related to the soil moisture content (#related to the drought)

Impact of heat/climate/drought
1. Literature: Climate and forest management influence nitrogen balance of European beech forests: microbial N transformations and inorganic N net uptake capacity of mycorrhizal roots
    https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-005-0055-9
    Related conclusion: Beech under warm–dry conditions: impaired N acquisition, higher ammonification and nitrification, lower denitrification rates and nitrate uptake capacity of trees  

2. Literature: Nitrogen balance in forest soils: nutritional limitation of plants under climate change stresses
                     (#A review summarizing the present understanding of ecosystem N cycling in N-limited forests and its interaction with extreme climate events, such as heat, drought and flooding,
                      with some potentially contradictory points)

    Related conclusion: 
    Heat          microbial release/consumption of N      increased N mineralization → increased inorganic N availability net nitrification decreased
                  N uptake                                increase in transporter activity in plants, increase in nitrate uptake in relative proportion to ammonium
    Drought       microbial release/consumption of N      decreased soil microbial activity
                                                          increased DON availability due to dieback of microbial biomass → increased N available for plant uptake
                                                          inhibition of gross nitrification (to be inhibited at very low soil moisture levels, to increase with soil moisture to an optimum, and then to decline as the soil becomes saturated)
                  N uptake                                decreased nitrate uptake → due to decreased nitrate uptake capacity accumulation of amino acids in roots → inhibiting N uptake reduction of fine root biomass → decreased nutrient absorbing surface
                  competition plant–plant/microbial N uptake       compensation of reduced N availability by access from deeper soil layers
                                                                   reduction of microbial competition in favour of plants
